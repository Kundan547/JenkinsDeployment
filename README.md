# E-Commerce Application with CI/CD Pipelines and Infrastructure as Code

## Overview
This repository contains an **E-Commerce Application** with integrated **CI/CD pipelines** and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** practices. The project is divided into specific branches for CI/CD tools and IaC implementations:

- **AWS Branch**: Deployment and infrastructure setup using AWS.
- **Deploy Branch**: CI/CD pipeline setup using **Jenkins**.
- **Ansible Branch**: Configuration management and application deployment using **Ansible**.
- **Terraform Branch**: Infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform**.

Each branch focuses on a specific deployment or automation strategy to ensure a modular and maintainable approach to the application lifecycle.

## Features
- **Scalable Backend**: Built using **Flask** with REST APIs for e-commerce functionalities.
- **Interactive Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript-based user interface.
- **Containerization**: Application packaged using **Docker**.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrated pipelines for automated testing, deployment, and scaling.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated infrastructure provisioning and configuration.
- **Modular Deployment**: Separate branches for AWS, Jenkins, Ansible, and Terraform implementations.

---

## Branches and Implementation

### 1. AWS Branch
**Purpose**: Deploy the E-Commerce Application on AWS infrastructure.

#### Key Features:
- Provisioning EC2 instances using AWS CLI or AWS SDK.
- Load Balancing using AWS **Elastic Load Balancer** (ELB).
- Auto-scaling with AWS **Auto Scaling Groups**.
- S3 for static content hosting.
- RDS for database management.

#### Deployment Steps:
1. Clone the `aws-branch`.
2. Configure AWS CLI credentials.
3. Execute `deploy.sh` to provision and deploy the application.

```bash
# Example AWS CLI setup
aws configure

# Deploy script
bash deploy.sh
```

---

### 2. Deploy Branch - Jenkins
**Purpose**: Automate application deployment with **Jenkins** CI/CD pipeline.

#### Key Features:
- Build, Test, and Deploy stages in the Jenkins pipeline.
- Integration with Docker for containerized deployment.
- Use of Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline as code.
- Trigger deployments on code pushes.

#### Deployment Steps:
1. Clone the `deploy-branch`.
2. Install and configure Jenkins.
3. Add a new pipeline in Jenkins with this repository.
4. Run the Jenkins pipeline.

**Jenkinsfile** Example:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t ecommerce-app:latest .'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'pytest tests/'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run -d -p 80:80 ecommerce-app:latest'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Ansible Branch
**Purpose**: Automate server configuration and application deployment using **Ansible**.

#### Key Features:
- Ansible playbooks for server provisioning and app deployment.
- Configures web server (Nginx/Apache) and application dependencies.
- Supports idempotent and automated deployments.

#### Deployment Steps:
1. Clone the `ansible-branch`.
2. Configure the inventory file with your server IPs.
3. Run the Ansible playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory deploy.yml
```

**Sample Playbook**:
```yaml
- name: Deploy E-Commerce App
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install dependencies
      apt:
        name: ['docker.io', 'python3-pip']
        state: present

    - name: Run the application
      command: docker run -d -p 80:80 ecommerce-app:latest
```

---

### 4. Terraform Branch
**Purpose**: Provision and manage infrastructure using **Terraform**.

#### Key Features:
- Provision EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets.
- Infrastructure defined as code for easy management and versioning.
- Supports scaling and resource monitoring.

#### Deployment Steps:
1. Clone the `terraform-branch`.
2. Initialize and apply the Terraform configuration:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

**Sample Terraform Script**:
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "ecommerce_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "E-Commerce App Server"
  }
}
```
